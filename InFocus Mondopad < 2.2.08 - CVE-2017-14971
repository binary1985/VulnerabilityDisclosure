Vulnerability Type:

Sensitive Hashed Credential Disclosure


Vulnerability Details:
=====================
Infocus Mondopad is vulnerable to a Hashed Credential Disclosure vulnerability. An authenticated user can upload a
malicious file, or an unauthenticated user can break out of Kiosk Mode and manually upload a malicious file which when
opened and clicked will create a SMB request to a rogue server. This rogue server will capture the NetNTLMv2 hash
and could relay this hash to another system configured with the same credentials not requiring SMB Signing.


Replication:
=====================
1) Malicious file can be uploaded (Excel spreadsheet) containing a UNC
path(hyperlink) to the Mondopad server.

2) User then opens the spreadsheet and click the embedded UNC link. 

3) The rogue server is able to capture the hashed SMB credential over the network. This type of an
attack can also be used to relay this credentials if configured the
same on other hosts.


Remediation Details:
=====================

malicious use.
