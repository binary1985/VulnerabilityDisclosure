Vendor:
==========================
VMWare

Product:
===========
VMWare Fusion
Validated on v8.5 (likely affects all product versions)

VMWare Fusion is a software hypervisor developed by VMware for Macintosh computers. VMware Fusion allows Intel-based Macs
to run operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, NetWare, or Solaris on Virtual Machines, along with their 
Mac OS X operating system using a combination of paravirtualization, hardware virtualization and dynamic recompilation.


Vulnerability Type:
==========================
Encryption Boot Password Bypass


Vulnerability Details:
=====================
With regards to implemented Virtual Machine Encryption, Per Documentation provided by VMWare located at:
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Fusion/8.0/com.vmware.fusion.using.doc/GUID-C0886101-1C5E-433C-8D40-5B01D0A1295C.html

The results of implementing encryption are: "The Virtual Machine is encrypted. Users must provide the encryption password 
to open, start, and resume the Virtual Machine."

Testing and research indicate that Encrypted Virtual Machines only need to enter passwords when opened. Once a Virtual 
Machine's window is open, even if paused, or powered off, VMWare Fusion does not require the encryption password to power 
on or resume Virtual Machines.

Not requiring the password to start or resume a Virtual Machine puts machines at risk of unauthorized access to the Virtual
Machine in the event the user did not close the Virtual Machine Window.


Replication:
=====================
1) Open an Encrypted Virtual Machine

2) Enter the Encryption Password to start Virtual Machine

3) Wait for Virtual Machine to Boot

4) Shut down Virtual Machine

5) Start Virtual Machine without entering Encryption Password


Remediation Details:
=====================
Ensure that Encrypted Virtual Machine windows are closed after shut down.
